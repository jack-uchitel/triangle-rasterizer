# triangle_rasterizer

This is some of the code from CS311: Computer Graphics. In it, we designed graphics engines 
using both triangle rasterization and ray tracing. The code was a collaboration between me and 
my class partner Jade Kandel, with unfinished starter code provided by our teacher, Josh Davis. 
The code, as it stands, does not run â€“ a couple key files were corrupted, and running the code 
requires additional software downloaded to ones computer.

This repository contains the code used for the ray tracing graphics engine. To see the triangle 
rasterization graphics engine, check out my other repository, triangle_rasterizer.
